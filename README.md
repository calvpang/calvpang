Hi, I'm Calvin Pang and currently working as a Data Scientist.

I'm particularly interested in deep learning and have successfully trained CNNs and Transformer models for production.
Currently, I'm learning about FastAI and HuggingFace as transfer learning cuts down a lot of the development time.
I'm also learning Django so I can deploy ML models for end users.

I'm also interested in Home Automation in my free time and am always investigating ways to automate my day to day activities.
